He did well against the 49ers last season and he'll get a chance to face them again in Week 1, but they did allow the ninth-fewest points to passers a year ago. Therefore, Murray is only a borderline starting candidate to open the season.","2":"The fact that Murray could come away from a matchup with a very tough San Francisco defense with a more-than-startworthy 26 fantasy points says a lot about the second-year pro. He gets a break this week against Washington, a defense that allowed the seventh-most QB fantasy points in 2019. Lock in Murray as a starter in all formats for this fantastic matchup.","3":"One of the best quarterbacks of the 2020 season gets a matchup with last season's sixth-best defense for opposing passers. This seems like an easy choice. Murray offers so much upside thanks to his running ability (158 yards and three scores through two games) and is easily one of the top overall choices at the QB position in Week 3.

The 2019 first overall pick struggled to 6.9 YPA and took a league-high 48 sacks, but he also finished strong by leading the Arizona offense to three-plus touchdowns in eight of the team's final 11 games. Murray's rushing ability helped him to a 93-544-4 rushing line (top-four in all three categories) and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points. Murray was already a strong bet for a second-year leap, but the addition of DeAndre Hopkins further adds to his appeal. The hype might lead to an irresponsible ADP, but there's little doubt Murray has elite upside. He's a solid fantasy starter.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":22.030881523999998,"externalId":"20203","id":"1120203","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":34.74274471,"1":22.3327525,"2":12.4099922,"3":246.0874107,"4":1.703425051,"5":49.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.204392282,"16":0.133570356,"17":0.210097775,"18":0.028378701,"19":0.096840779,"20":0.765703426,"21":0.642803345,"22":246.0874107,"23":7.280522249,"24":44.48891998,"25":0.433987873,"26":0.013144586,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.01425088,"36":0.009975616,"37":0.0865,"38":0.00295,"39":6.110677018,"40":44.48891998,"62":0.109985364,"63":0.00174,"64":2.619294583,"65":0.331911272,"66":0.06467761,"68":0.396588882,"69":0.159317411,"70":0.029751701,"72":0.189069111,"73":0.954772537,"210":1.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":4,"totalRanking":7,"totalRating":58.44}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1601190000000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":15795,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":36,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":36,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"DeAndre","fullName":"DeAndre Hopkins","id":15795,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Hopkins","lastNewsDate":1600649500000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Hopkins has thrived with varying levels of quality at quarterback in his career.

Arizona's offense is a candidate for a leap in quarterback Kyler Murray's second season, which makes Gonzalez a fine last-round flier.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":8.048844172999999,"externalId":"20203","id":"1120203","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.191575965,"75":0.310639523,"76":0.119063558,"77":0.472549847,"78":0.643612606,"79":0.171062759,"80":0.987311483,"81":1.07607155,"82":0.088760067,"83":1.651437295,"84":2.030323679,"85":0.378886383,"86":2.617716894,"87":2.852429896,"88":0.234713002,"198":0.191575965,"199":0.310639523,"200":0.119063558}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":8,"totalRanking":143,"totalRating":19.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1601190000000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3119195,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"published":false,"rank":160,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":1,"published":false,"rank":160,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Chase","fullName":"Chase Edmonds","id":3119195,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"29","lastName":"Edmonds","lastNewsDate":1600819678000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Edmonds had long been seen as a backup plan to David Johnson.

As Larry Fitzgerald gets even closer to riding off into retirement, Kirk should grow into a solid role as the No. 2 receiver behind DeAndre Hopkins. For now, though, with all three receivers in the lineup and a great pass-catching back in Kenyan Drake, it's hard to trust Kirk as anything more than a flex option, given so much competition for targets.","2":"Kirk couldn't find his rhythm in Week 1, catching only one of his five targets and failing to even pick up a yard on his lone reception. That said, five targets was still good enough for a three-way tie for second on the Arizona offense, which is about where we expected Kirk to be heading into the season. He's still a flex option, albiet a low-ceiling one, heading into Week 2 against a Washington defense that looks to be improved, though not unbeatable.","3":"Kirk saw fewer targets and played on fewer snaps than veteran Larry Fitzgerald in Week 2, which is a major issue for those relying on Kirk as a starting wideout in fantasy. If he's truly splitting work with Fitzgerald behind fantasy superstar DeAndre Hopkins, that likely leaves both as risky flex picks every week. Against the Lions' porous pass defense, consisder Kirk no more than a low-end WR3/flex option."}},"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8546666666666667,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.29592320148045337,"averageDraftPosition":145.13781644023067,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-9.167579449945407,"date":1601038814324,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-10.972151285658434,"percentOwned":56.75536045922674,"percentStarted":3.289295964882661},"proTeamId":22,"rankings":{"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"After flashing in a situational role as a rookie in 2018, Kirk saw a boost in usage and was the WR29 during 13 active weeks last season. The former second-round pick handled a very generous 24% target share in his first season with Kyler Murray in Kliff Kingsbury's system. However, he didn't see much work near the goal line (only four end-zone targets) and his 6.8 YPT ranked near the basement of the league. Moving forward, Kirk is a near lock for a big reduction in targets with superstar DeAndre Hopkins now sitting atop the depth chart. Kirk, who has already missed seven games due to injury, will also need to fend off Larry Fitzgerald, Hakeem Butler and Andy Isabella (among others) for targets. The 23-year-old is no more than a borderline flex in deeper leagues.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.6993120169,"externalId":"20203","id":"1120203","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.764634126,"24":5.080930789,"25":0.022695162,"26":6.87E-4,"27":1.0,"35":0.001412184,"36":9.89E-4,"37":0.00109,"38":3.74E-5,"39":6.644917638,"40":10.16186158,"62":6.87389E-4,"63":2.55E-5,"66":0.005787647,"68":0.005787647,"70":0.002662317,"72":0.002662317,"73":0.002662317,"102":0.0098076,"115":10.30612903,"118":1.0,"210":0.5}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":101,"totalRanking":267,"totalRating":9.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1601190000000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3040206,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1130,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Chris","fullName":"Chris Streveler","id":3040206,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Streveler","lastNewsDate":1600112148000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0013315579227696406,"auctionValueAverageChange":-5.877923399087389E-5,"averageDraftPosition":169.70298142717496,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.2574425573237704,"date":1601038811187,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.007569147845539914,"percentOwned":0.020595035494653764,"percentStarted":0.004746181019344078},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.43745004618,"externalId":"20203","id":"1120203","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":0.181741352,"1":0.107150401,"2":0.074590951,"3":1.252464537,"4":0.00817287,"15":0.004178147,"16":0.002730419,"17":0.002008215,"18":2.71257E-4,"19":4.86637E-4,"20":0.006476618,"21":0.58957634,"22":1.252464537,"23":0.515832913,"24":2.218081527,"25":0.025381196,"26":7.68743E-4,"35":9.50502E-4,"36":6.65351E-4,"37":1.99E-4,"38":6.81E-6,"39":4.3,"40":2.218081527,"62":0.00125538,"63":4.37E-5,"64":0.014742797,"65":0.002742006,"66":0.007198632,"68":0.009940638,"69":0.001316163,"70":0.003311371,"72":0.004627534,"73":0.011104152,"210":1.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":36,"totalRanking":402,"totalRating":0.3}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1601190000000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4242873,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":455,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":455,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[25,2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Eno","fullName":"Eno Benjamin","id":4242873,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"26","lastName":"Benjamin","lastNewsDate":1599347243000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0013333333333333333,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.004565348137867222,"averageDraftPosition":169.95650474049458,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.210668726728386,"date":1601038802003,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.06344908011589517,"percentOwned":0.2914083498791145,"percentStarted":0.009201480340910626},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20203","id":"1120203","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1601190000000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":2970726,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1038,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1049,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[5,6,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Maxx","fullName":"Maxx Williams","id":2970726,"injured":true,"injuryStatus":"INJURY_RESERVE","jersey":"87","lastName":"Williams","lastNewsDate":1600721178000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Tight ends are not utilized that often in Kliff Kingsbury's offense, and Williams had poor production in 2019 as a result.
