      "\"Receiver Air Yards are the total number of yards thrown toward a receiver on a play in which he is targeted, both complete and incomplete. If you add them up over a game or a season, you get a receiver\u2019s total Air Yards . . . Air Yards aren\u2019t a measure of how much distance the ball actually travelled. Instead, they measure potential yards a receiver would have produced if he caught the ball and then was immediately tackled.\" Josh Hermsmeyer, <a href='http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/69265/446/why-receiver-air-yards-matter'>Why Receiver Air Yards Matter</a> (Feb. 15, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "As explained in this article (as well as articles and podcasts on RotoViz.com), we care about Air Yards because they (1) give us information about how an offense intends to use a receiver and (2) help identify receivers whose production could meaningfully change if their efficiency spikes or falls."

Don't worry that the examples in the book use slightly different data formats and programming languages (perl, xml, and mysql) than I'll use here (python, json, and postgresql). I learned a good deal from Hacks 25-27 (\"Spider Baseball Sites for Data,\" Discover How Live Score Applications Work,\" and \"Keep Your Stats Database Up to Date\") and translated the methodologies to other sports and websites. \n",
